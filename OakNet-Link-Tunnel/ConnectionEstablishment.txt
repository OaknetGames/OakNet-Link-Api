1. Stranger asks MasterServer to connect to specific IP
	ClientA -> "TunnelConnectionRequest" -> Master

2.1 If Ip doesn't belongs to a Client Master sends an Error
	Master -> "TunnelConnectionResponse" -> ClientA

2.2 Ip Exists Request to other Client
	Master -> "StrangerTunnelConnectionRequest" -> ClientB

3. Other client decides if the connection is allowed
	ClientB -> "StrangerTunnelConnectionResponse" -> Master
   If allowed ClientB beginns the holepunch process (Handled by the underlying API)
	ClientB ==> ClientA 

4. Master tell first Client if connection can be established
	Master -> "TunnelConnectionResponse" -> ClientA
   If allowed
	ClientA ==> ClientB

5. Connection Established
	ClientA <==> ClientB
