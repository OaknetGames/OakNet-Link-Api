# OakNet-Link-New
The Project goal is to provide easy access to Client-Server based Multiplayer games for everyone. 

# Basic Concept
Connecting to a private IP address in the OakNet-Link network establishes a peer to peer VPN tunnel to redirect the games traffic.

#Current Status (rough overview):
Peer to peer connection establishment: working but mostly untested
Peer to peer tunnels: working but mostly untested
App: in development
	Server management: not started yet
DNS system: in planning and concepting 

# Network Concepts:
